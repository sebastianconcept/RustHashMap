# RustHashMap
FFI reachable C-Shared lib made with a thread-safe HashMap in Rust.

## Build
To create a fresh version, from the project root directory, run:

    ./build.sh

That will create a `target/debug/librusthashmap.dynlib` in macOS, also its associated headers file.

## Inner benchmark
From [Pharo](https://pharo.org/) running the built-in Rust benchmark on 10K operations:

```Smalltalk
sample1 := '{"id":123,"name":"Sample JSON","description":"This is a sample JSON object with approximately 1024 bytes of data. It''s used for demonstration purposes.","tags":["json","sample","data"],"details":{"created_at":"2023-04-01T12:00:00","updated_at":"2023-04-01T14:30:00","status":"active"},"values":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],"settings":{"enabled":true,"threshold":50,"options":["option1","option2","option3"]},"comments":[{"user":"user1","text":"This is a comment."},{"user":"user2","text":"Another comment here."}]}'.

RustHashMap benchmark: 10 * 1000 withPayload: sample1.
```
On this hardware [1] it renders:

## FFI usage from Pharo compared to Redis

With [RediStick](https://github.com/mumez/RediStick) and [ABBench](https://github.com/emdonahue/ABBench) installed you can benchmark this lib against Redis. Here is a snippet with the numbers provided with this hardware [1]:

```Smalltalk
RsRedisConnectionPool primaryUrl: 'sync://localhost:6379'.
redis := RsRedisProxy of: #client1.

sample1 := '{"id":123,"name":"Sample JSON","description":"This is a sample JSON object with approximately 1024 bytes of data. It''s used for demonstration purposes.","tags":["json","sample","data"],"details":{"created_at":"2023-04-01T12:00:00","updated_at":"2023-04-01T14:30:00","status":"active"},"values":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],"settings":{"enabled":true,"threshold":50,"options":["option1","option2","option3"]},"comments":[{"user":"user1","text":"This is a comment."},{"user":"user2","text":"Another comment here."}]}'.

keys := (1 to: 10000) collect:[ :e | UUID new asString36 ].
values := (1 to: 10000) collect:[ :e | UUID new asString36, '-',sample1 ].
source := Dictionary newFromAssociations: (keys withIndexCollect:[ :k :i | k -> (values at: i)]).

"Setting values in RustHashMap lib via FFI"
Time millisecondsToRun: [ source keysAndValuesDo: [ :k :v | RustHashMap set: k with: v ] ]. 
"293"

"Getting values from RustHashMap lib via FFI"
Time millisecondsToRun: [ keys collect: [ :k | RustHashMap get: k ] ]. 
"656"

"Setting values in a local Redis"
Time millisecondsToRun: [ source keysAndValuesDo: [ :k :v | redis at: k put: v ] ]. 
"1582"

"Getting values from a local Redis"
Time millisecondsToRun: [ keys collect: [ :k | redis at: k ] ]. 
"1501"

"Comparing repeated same write"
ABBench bench: [ ABBench 
	a: [ RustHashMap set: keys anyOne with: values anyOne ] 
	b: [ redis at: keys anyOne put: values anyOne ] ]. 
"B is 83.71% SLOWER than A"

"Comparing repeated same read"
ABBench bench: [ ABBench 
	a: [ RustHashMap get: keys anyOne ] 
	b: [ redis at: keys anyOne  ] ]. 
 "B is 62.46% SLOWER than A"
```

## Example of usage in Rust:

```rust
// Import the Storage struct and associated lazy_static instances.
use crate::Storage;
use lazy_static::lazy_static;
use std::sync::Mutex;

lazy_static! {
    pub static ref STORAGE: Mutex<Storage> = Mutex::new(Storage::new());
}

fn main() {
    // Create a mutable reference to the global STORAGE instance.
    let mut storage = Storage::new();

    // Set key-value pairs.
    storage.set("name".to_string(), "John".to_string());
    storage.set("age".to_string(), "30".to_string());

    // Retrieve and print values.
     if let Some(name) = storage.get("name".to_string()) {
         println!("Name: {}", name);
     }

     if let Some(age) = storage.get("age".to_string()) {
         println!("Age: {}", age);
     }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Storage` instance, set key-value pairs, and retrieve values.
The `lazy_static` crate is used for creating a global, lazy-initialized instance of `Storage`.

This doesn't have any dependencies other than `Rust` itself:
